# `lens`

`lens` is your lens to view the Cosmos :atom:. `lens` packs all the best practices in golang cosmos client development into one place and provides a simple and easy to use APIs provided by standard Cosmos chains. The `cmd` package implements the `lens` command line tool while the `client` package contains all the building blocks to build your own, complex, feature rich, Cosmos client in go.

Intended use cases:
- Trading Bots
- Server side query integrations for alerting or other automation
- Indexers and search engines
- Transaction automation (`x/authz` for security) for farming applications
- ...:atom::rocket::moon:

This is the start of ideas around how to implement the cosmos client libraries in a seperate repo.
